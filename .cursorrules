# Create-MCP

## Project Context

A CLI tool that sets up a Model Control Protocol (MCP) server and deploys it to Cloudflare Workers so you can start making new tools for your Cursor Agent in minutes.

This is super useful if you want to add MCP tools to your Cursor Agent to call APIs or other services.

### The tool will

- Clone the template repository
- Install dependencies
- Initialize a Git repository
- Set up the MCP server
- Deploy a Cloudflare Workers with the same name as the server
- Add it to Claude Desktop
- Copy the MCP server command to your clipboard so you can paste it into Cursor
