## Testing the CLI locally

You can test the CLI locally (from the root folder) using this command that changes to the tmp directory and runs the cli.ts in its parent folder. The tmp/ folder is gitignored, so we can clone repos in subdirectories of tmp/

```bash
cd tmp && bun ../cli.ts
```

or with options:

```bash
cd tmp && bun ../cli.ts --name my-server
```

```bash
cd tmp && bun ../cli.ts --clone https://github.com/user/repo
```
